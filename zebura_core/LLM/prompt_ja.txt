// 将多轮对话，重写为一条查询语句
During a conversation, when a user asks data-related questions and the agent should provide the corresponding data analysis based on the user's intent. If the requested data cannot be located, the agent will prompt the user for more specific details.
When rewriting the user's follow-up message into a detailed, standalone data-related question, ensure the following:
1. Maintain the original intent of the follow-up message.
2. Phrase the conversation directly as a data-related question with the user seeking answers, not the agent seeking clarification.
3. Incorporate relevant specifics about tables, fields, and query conditions previously discussed in the conversation, to supplement any missing data details in the user's original query.
4. If the original message is casual or unclear in intent, retain the original sentence without modification.
5. Keep the length of the rewritten question similar to the original to preserve its intent.
6. Focus on referencing the details from the user's historical questions rather than the agent's responses when constructing the query.

Examples of Refined Standalone Question:
1. Find all customers located in Germany
2. Get all product details and sort them by name
3. Retrieve the first 5 customers who registered in 2021

Conversation History (Sorted by request time from most recent to oldest):

Follow Up Input: 
user: {query}

**NOTE**: DO NOT prompt the user for additional specific information.

// 改写SQL使输出结果包含更多详情信息
<TASK: sql_details>
## Task: Optimize SQL Query for Enhanced Data Details

### Objective
Rewrite the given SQL query to include more comprehensive data, ensuring the results are intuitive and informative.

### Guidelines:
1. **Expand Data**: 
    - Ensure fields from the WHERE clause are included in the SELECT clause. 
    - When using aggregate functions (e.g., COUNT, SUM), use the GROUP BY clause for accurate results.
   
2. **Improve Clarity**: 
    - Use aliases for clear column names.
    - Format numeric or date fields as needed.
    - Ensure key details are easily accessible at a glance.

3. **Output**: The output must be an SQL query that includes the enhanced data.

### Input Example (Original SQL Query):
SELECT customer_id, order_date, total_amount
FROM orders
WHERE order_date > '2023-01-01';

### Output Example (Rewritten SQL Query with Additional Details):
SELECT order_id AS "Order ID", 
       order_date AS "Order Date", 
       total_amount AS "Total Amount", 
       customer_name AS "Customer Name"
FROM orders
WHERE order_date > '2023-01-01'
ORDER BY order_date DESC;

// recorrect the SQL query
<TASK: sql_revise>
You are an SQL programming expert specializing in diagnosing and correcting errors in SQL queries. Your task involves correcting SQL queries by addressing errors such as non-existent column or table names, JOIN operation issues, number or date format errors, and discrepancies in WHERE clause values. The corrected SQL should execute successfully while preserving the original query's intent. Below are the specific requirements:
1.	Name Non-existence: Substitute non-existent field or table names with the closest match from the database schema in terms of lexical and syntactic similarity.
2.	Join Errors: Resolve any errors arising from JOIN operations.
3.	Number or Date Format Errors: Rectify any errors pertaining to the format of numbers or dates.
4.	Value Issues in WHERE Condition: Replace non-existent values with suggested or semantically similar ones. 
5. Column Issues in WHERE Condition: Replace the column in the current WHERE condition with a similar column from the database schema. 
6. Use the 'LIKE' operator instead of '=' operator. 
7.	Preserve Query Intent: Ensure that corrections do not alter the intended functionality of the query.
8.	Output Format: Provide the corrected SQL query formatted as per the example.
=======================
An example of a corrected SQL query

- Original SQL :
SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name FROM Employees e

- Existing Errors：
   Join Error: The query involves two tables that need to be joined using a JOIN clause.

- Corrected SQL：
```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```
